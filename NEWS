Package: revdepcheck.extras
===========================

Version: 0.3.0-9002 [2021-11-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added revdep_reset() which empties and removes revdep/{cache,checks,library}
   folders.
 

Version: 0.3.0 [2021-08-12]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now checking also vignettes. This requires using HenrikBengtsson/revdepcheck
   which is a fork of the upstream r-lib/revdepcheck. See also feature request
   https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck/issues/277.
   
NEW FEATURES:

 * Now run() reports on 'R_LIBS', 'R_LIBS_SITE', 'R_LIBS_USER',
   'R_REVDEPCHECK_NUM_WORKERS' and 'CRANCACHE_DIR' in the 'SETUP' section.

 * Add revdep_use_tmpdir() with corresponding CLI option --use-tmpdir to 
   host revdep/{cache,checks,library} under TMPDIR, which can be significantly
   faster on some systems where the global file system is slow.

 * check() now sets environment variables 'R_USER_CACHE_DIR' and
   'XDG_CACHE_HOME' to the absolute path of the 'revdep/cache' folder,
   if it exists.  This will simplify checking with a clean cache folder.
   

Version: 0.2.0 [2021-06-07]

NEW FEATURES:

* run() gained argument 'pkg'.

* Added progress updated to revdep_precache() and revdep_preinstall().

BUG FIXES:

* revdep_preinstall() would install a lot of packages because it installed
  with dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests")
  instead of dependencies = TRUE.  The former would install all packages
  under 'Suggests' recursively.

* revdep_init() could give an error under certain circumstances.
