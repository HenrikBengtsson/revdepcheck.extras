Package: revdepcheck.extras
===========================

Version: 0.2.0-9000 [2021-06-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now run() reports on 'R_LIBS', 'R_LIBS_SITE', 'R_LIBS_USER',
   'R_REVDEPCHECK_NUM_WORKERS' and 'CRANCACHE_DIR' in the 'SETUP' section.

 * Add revdep_use_tmpdir() with corresponding CLI option --use-tmpdir.
 

Version: 0.2.0 [2021-06-07]

NEW FEATURES:

* run() gained argument 'pkg'.

* Added progress updated to revdep_precache() and revdep_preinstall().

BUG FIXES:

* revdep_preinstall() would install a lot of packages because it installed
  with dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests")
  instead of dependencies = TRUE.  The former would install all packages
  under 'Suggests' recursively.

* revdep_init() could give an error under certain circumstances.
